## 🧰 The SDK

Clean Arch Enablers (CAE) is an SDK designed to facilitate the application of clean architecture during software development, starting initially from the Java world. By using the SDK, software is created in both modular and easy-to-read manners, enabling numerous possibilities by harnessing the foundational architecture principles.

## 🛠️ The tools

### [cae-framework](https://github.com/clean-arch-enablers-project/cae-framework)

From the CAE perspective, clean architecture leverages hexagonal principles by using the Ports & Adapters concept and mixing it with a flavor of the Vertical Slice pattern, componentizing an application by its use cases. That's the premise behind the _cae-framework_: shaping an application based on the axis of its use cases and plugging satellites around them as needed.
