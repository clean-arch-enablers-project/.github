## ⚡Joining the force

If anyone gets interested in becoming an official collaborator, it is very simple. The workflow is:

1. 🔍 Identify where it would be interesting to collaborate.
2. 📝 Open a new issue on the repository that has an opportunity for enhancement, specifying the intended changes.
3. 🛠️ Create a new branch to address the changes (allowed prefixes: _feature/_, _refact/_, _docs/_, or _fix/_).
5. 📩 Once it is done, open a new pull request.
6. 🔀 Pass through the code review phase.
7. ✅ Welcome to the team!

Once completed the workflow, the developer gets associated with our GitHub and LinkedIn organization pages.
